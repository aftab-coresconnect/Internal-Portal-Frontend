## Practical Tips for Implementation
- Start small: Focus on getting a minimal working application before adding advanced features
- Use libraries wisely: Leverage existing packages for complex features like charts and forms
- Develop iteratively: Complete one feature before moving to the next
- Prioritize authentication: Get the security foundation right from the start
- Test continuously: Don't leave testing until the end
- Document as you go: Add comments and documentation during development
- Use feature branches: Create separate branches for each feature
- Regular commits: Commit code frequently with descriptive messages
- Demo early: Get stakeholder feedback on early versions

This guide provides a structured approach to implementing the Internal Portal. Start with the foundation and progressively build up the functionality, focusing on one phase at a time.
